# TODO.md for the DTP esoteric programming language.

This is the project's TODO.md

I sure hope all of these will be done... eventually.

### Todo
- [ ] Be able to print special characters with "|".
- [ ] If the print function only has "|" or that plus a non-special character, it'll result in an error.
- [ ] Make syntax, "compiler" (more like "interpreter") and execution errors.
- [ ] IMPLEMENT. FUNCTIONS. NOW.
- [ ] Make single character variable (char) and change this readme once it's done.

### In progress
- [ ] Some other stuff (lazy).

### Done âœ“
- [x] Print variable special arguments (no symbol, dot and underscore).
